# CPPND: Capstone Tennis Game

This is my repo for the Capstone project in the [Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213).

I ve used the https://github.com/udacity/CppND-Capstone-Snake-Game as a base which was inspired by [this](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/212296/snake-game-in-c-with-sdl) excellent StackOverflow post and set of responses.

The Capstone Project gave me a chance to integrate what i've learned throughout this program. 

This project remakes the classic atari game "pong".

## Feature-list:
* 2 Players which can move their tennis-racket
  * one player with arrow-up / arrow-down
  * one player with w-key / s-key
* ball
  * starts at center of the game
  * starts moving in a random direction
  * a new ball can be generated with the space-key
  * if ball hits side-wall, it bounces in a random-opposite direction
* counting points
  * if ball hits wall behind one player, the opposite player gains one point and ball disapears
  * points are counted at the top-bar
